## 1. Bandcamp Introduction

> ==Trumpeter==, bandleader and ==composer== Matthew Halsall announces ==landmark== new album An Ever Changing View, an ==expansive==, ==immaculately== ==conceived== project which presents Halsall’s signature ==blend== of jazz, electronica, global and spiritual jazz influences.
>
> Halsall who has been ==hailed== as one of the leading figures of the UK jazz ==renaissance== has never seen himself as part of any one sound or scene: he builds his own ==sonic== universe instead. An Ever Changing View finds him at his most experimental yet, once again expanding his sound and production techniques to create his unique brand of deeply ==meditative== music.
>
> During the album's creation, he was staying in both a beautiful architect’s house with breath-taking sea views and a ==striking== modernist house, where he composed what he saw “like a landscape painting”. In these new environments, Halsall wanted to capture “the feeling of ==openness== and ==escapism==” and to approach making music again from scratch. “I hit the reset button and wanted to have complete musical freedom,” he says. “It was a real exploration of sound.”
>
> An Ever Changing View comes in a package as striking as the music, with handmade fonts designed by Ian Anderson of The Designers Republic and the specially ==commissioned== ==tapestry== by artist Sara Kelly is a stunning and harmonious complement to the record's sound.

> This was just ==gorgeous==, really ==appealing==, ==charming== spiritual jazz.  
> 
> He uses a wide ==palette== of instruments and field recordings to recreate places in nature he has visited in Wales and Northumberland. The feel is of one relaxing by a fireside after a day hiking somewhere nice. "mountains, trees and the sea" ==typifies== this.  
> 
> I especially love the ==melancholy== but ==melodic== ==trumpet== among all the electric piano, ==tinkling== ==percussion== and ==chimes==. It all just ==slips down== so easy,with a quite wonderful ==meditative== atmosphere  
> 
> Looking forward to hearing more of his work.
